## Matt Paul

I spent a successful decade in the music industry, notable acheivements including a Grammy Nomination for work on Amy Winehouse 'Back to Black' album, and the broadcast mix for the largest ever live streaming in YouTube's history, U2's Live at the Rosebowl concert(10 million live streams worldwide). 

After leaving the music industy in 2013, and spending a couple of years developing key business skills in a small and dynamic foodservice business,  I am now looking for an entry level developer job with a focus on continual learning, software craftmanship, and TDD/BDD. 

## Skills

#### Business Analysis and Improving Productivity

 - Managed the business requirements, product development and implemtation of a new [proof of delivery and vehicle tracking system](www.podfather.com) with both internal and external developers that allowed the company to track deliveries and automate a process that had previously been paper based.  This resulted in 20% less administration and processing per delivery whilst offering improved customer service.

 -  Reduced brochure creation time from average of 6 months to 5 weeks . Due to new business requirements, I re-evaluated the catalogue creation process, and identified a solution that allowed far greater automation and ongoing continual incremental updates.

 -  I project managed the upgrade of the ERP software, [Microsoft Dynamics Nav](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/dynamics/erp-nav-overview.aspx), working with external developers and internal stakeholders in order to smoothly transition a circa 1998 system to a modern version. 
 

#### Teamwork and Training

 - Within Klaremont, I also managed the Marketing team and trained them to use of the company's CMS, basic HTML and CSS, and SEO techniques, as well as creating a digital strategy.

 - Trained up juniors at Metropolis, a world renowned recording studio, teaching best practices and maintaining the high technical standards that it is known for. I feel extremely lucky to have started my career here, as it was a fantastic training environment still very much routed in the 'work your way up from the bottom' ethos, and I relished receiving and passing on skills from people, some of whom had spent decades in pursuit of excellence at the highest level. 

???? Under entrepreneurial ? With other examples ?
 - I cofounded a 14,000ft arts venue on Commercial Road E1, and managed a team of up to 20 security, bar staff and technicians, as well as developed / managed relationships with external promoters, galleries, the council, and community groups. 


## Education

#### Makers Academy (August 2015 to November 2015)

- My final project at Makers Academy was for [Alarming](https://github.com/hvenables/alarming), a social alarm clock, in which we choose to use Ionic and Firebase, two technologies that we had not covered in the course.
 
- Taught best practices and principles of software engineering - OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC, DDD

- Extensive experience of pairing and group projects, in addition to working on my own.

- Use of version control software from day 1 (Git, Github), including branching and dealing with merge conflicts.

#### Google Squared Digital Marketing Certificate 2015
 - 6 month part time course, focusing on startups and digital marketing, developed by Google and endorsed by the IPA.
